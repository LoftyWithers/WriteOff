   “Alright, squirt,” Rainbow Dash said, “let’s go over it one more time.”

   “Right!” Scootaloo said, her wings buzzing in excitement. Today, she was
   going to fly, just like her big sister. Rainbow Dash said so, and they’d
   been planning it out all morning.

promptGuide: |
   - Prompts should&mdash;
      - be a short phrase or figure of speech;
      - not lock participants into certain characters, settings, or plots; and
      - be suitable for use as a title for the event; and therefore
      - be in title case, using the following rules:
         1. the first and last words are capitalised;
         2. articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions shorter than 5 characters are not capitalised;
         3. everything else is capitalised.
emailNotifsHint: |
   You will only receive notifications that match your selections,
   e.g., when a FiM Minific event is created, you will only be notified if
   you have "Event created", "FiM", and "Minific" selected.
watermarkHint: |
   Watermark the submission in the chosen position. "None" is recommended.
   This option is to provide a standardised watermark for those who feel it's
   necessary.
