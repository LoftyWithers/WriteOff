   “Alright, squirt,” Rainbow Dash said, “let’s go over it one more time.”

   “Right!” Scootaloo said, her wings buzzing in excitement. Today, she was
   going to fly, just like her big sister. Rainbow Dash said so, and they’d
   been planning it out all morning.

   - be in title case, using the following rules:
      1. the first and last words are capitalised;
      2. articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions 4 letters or shorter are not capitalised;
      3. everything else is capitalised.
