# Formatting & Style Guide

## Fic Style

To aid with author anonymity, the following style rules should be applied to all
submitted stories.

1. Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.
2. Scene breaks should be indicated by an [hr] in its own paragraph.
3. Weak scene breaks should be indicated by a blank paragraph, i.e, three blank lines.
4. Sentences should be separated by a single space.

### Example

	This is a sentence. Sentences have exactly one space between them.

	This is a new paragraph.

	[hr]

	There was a scene break just there.



	There was a weak scene break just there.

## Fic Formatting

Stories can be formatted using BBCode. The following tags are supported:

	[hr]                             Horizontal rule
	[b]<text>[/b]                    Bold text
	[i]<text>[/i]                    Italicised text
	[u]<text>[/u]                    Underlined text
	[s]<text>[/s]                    Struck-out text
	[smcaps]<text>[/smcaps]          Text in small caps
	[center]<text>[/center]          Centred text
	[right]<text>[/right]            Right-aligned text
	[quote]<text>[/quote]            A block quote
	[url="<url>"]<text>[/url]        A link to <url>
	[size="<size>"]<text>[/size]     Re-sized text
	[color="<color>"]<text>[/color]  Coloured text

For [size], the argument can be in px or em (see
[Lengths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#Lengths)),
with the default being px. However, using em is recommended.

For [color], the argument can be an RGB hex value (e.g. #ff0000 for red),
or a [recognised colour
name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#colors_table).

## Pic Formatting

To aid with author anonymity, identifying marks of any kind (e.g., signatures)
are not allowed. If a watermark is desired, one linking to the pic's page can
be generated automatically.

In addition, the following should be taken into consideration:

1. Images must be at least 225x225px
2. Images larger than 1800x1800px will be scaled down
3. Images will be displayed in a container with max-width of about 900px
4. Gallery thumbnails are at most 225x225px
5. Images will be compressed with JPEG quality 90
